# Privacy Policy for SelfieYear

**Last Updated: July 5, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the SelfieYear mobile application (the "App"). Your privacy is critically important to us, and the App has been designed from the ground up to be a private and secure experience.

## 1. Core Privacy Principle: On-Device Processing

The fundamental principle of SelfieYear is that **all of your data is processed and stored exclusively on your own device.**

*   We do **not** collect, upload, store, or transmit any of your photos, videos, or personal information to our servers or any third-party servers.
*   The entire process, from creating albums to generating videos, happens locally on your iPhone or iPad.
*   Your content never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to share it using the standard iOS sharing features after saving the video to your Photo Library.

## 2. Face Data Processing

To provide its core functionality, the App processes images containing faces. We are committed to handling this sensitive data with the utmost care and transparency.

*   **What face data is processed?**
    The App uses Apple's on-device Vision framework to detect the presence and location (bounding box) of faces within the photos you select. This is done to align the images for a smooth video transition. The App does **not** collect or store facial recognition data, facial features, or any other biometric identifiers. The data processed is ephemeral and only consists of coordinate data for the alignment process.

*   **How is face data used?**
    The sole purpose of processing face data is to calculate the position and scale needed to center your face in each frame of the generated video. This processing is performed entirely on your device and is essential for the App's core feature.

*   **Is face data shared with third parties?**
    **No.** Since all processing is done on your device, no face data, photos, or videos are ever shared with us or any third party.

*   **How long is face data retained?**
    Face data (the coordinate information) is **not retained**. It is used momentarily during the video generation process and is immediately discarded once the process is complete. It is never saved to your device's storage or transmitted anywhere.

## 3. Information We Do Not Collect

To be perfectly clear, we do **not** collect, access, or have the ability to see any of the following:
*   The photos you import into the App.
*   The videos you generate.
*   Biometric face data.
*   Your name, email address, or other personal contact information.
*   Location data.
*   Usage analytics or crash reports.

## 4. How Your Data is Handled

*   **Data Storage:** All photos you add to an album are stored in a private, sandboxed container on your device, which other apps cannot access.
*   **Data Deletion:** When you delete a photo, an album, or the App itself, the corresponding data is permanently removed from your device's storage.

## 5. Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.

## 6. Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). The App's functionality is entirely offline and does not involve the collection of personal data.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by updating the "Last Updated" date of this policy.
