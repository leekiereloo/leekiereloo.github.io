**1000 Rejections**

## The App

1000 Rejections helps you embrace rejection as a path to success. Track your asks, celebrate your rejections, and watch your courage grow.

**The core insight:** If you're not getting rejected, you're not asking for enough.

## How It Works

1. **Log an Ask** — Record what you asked for
2. **Track the Outcome** — Mark it as Rejected or Win
3. **Reflect & Learn** — Capture insights from each rejection
4. **Reach 1000** — Build resilience one "no" at a time
