# Privacy Policy for SelfieYear

**Last Updated: July 4, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the SelfieYear mobile application (the "App"). Your privacy is critically important to us, and the App has been designed from the ground up to be a private and secure experience.

## 1. Core Privacy Principle: On-Device Processing

The fundamental principle of SelfieYear is that **all of your data is processed and stored exclusively on your own device.**

*   We do **not** collect, upload, store, or transmit any of your photos, videos, or personal information to our servers or any third-party servers.
*   The entire process, from creating albums to generating videos, happens locally on your iPhone or iPad.
*   Your content never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to share it using the standard iOS sharing features after saving the video to your Photo Library.

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect

To be perfectly clear, we do **not** collect, access, or have the ability to see any of the following: 
*   The photos you import into the App.
*   The albums you create.
*   The videos you generate.
*   Your name, email address, or other personal contact information.
*   Location data.
*   Usage analytics or crash reports.

## 3. Information You Provide Access To

When you use the App, you grant it permission to access certain features on your device. This access is managed by the iOS operating system and is required for the App to function.

*   **Photo Library Access (`Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description`):** You grant the App permission to read photos from your library so you can select them to create an album. This access is read-only for the purpose of selection. We do not copy your library or store it elsewhere.
*   **Camera Access (`Privacy - Camera Usage Description`):** You grant the App permission to use the camera so you can take new photos to add to your albums. Photos taken are saved directly within the App's local storage.
*   **Saving to Photo Library (`Privacy - Photo Library Additions Usage Description`):** You grant the App permission to save the final generated video to your device's Photo Library. This is a "write-only" permission and does not grant the app the ability to read your other photos.
*   **Notifications (`Privacy - User Notifications Usage Description`):** If you enable daily reminders, you grant the App permission to schedule local notifications. These notifications are managed entirely by your device's operating system. We do not know if or when you receive them.

## 4. How Your Data is Handled

*   **Data Storage:** All photos you add to an album are stored in a private, sandboxed container on your device, which other apps cannot access.
*   **Face Detection:** The face detection and alignment process is performed by Apple's on-device Vision framework. The biometric data used for detection is not stored or transmitted.
*   **Video Generation:** The video is assembled and rendered entirely on your device.
*   **Data Deletion:** When you delete a photo, an album, or the App itself, the corresponding data is permanently removed from your device's storage.

## 5. Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.

## 6. Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). The App's functionality is entirely offline and does not involve the collection of personal data.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by updating the "Last Updated" date of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
