# Privacy Policy for Contact Dates

**Effective Date:** 13 July 2025

Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how Contact Dates handles your information.

Our core privacy principle is simple: **Contact Dates is designed to work entirely on your device.** We do not collect, store, or share your personal data.

## Information We Collect and How We Use It

### Contact Information

To provide its core functionality, Contact Dates requests **read-only access** to your device's contacts.

- **What We Access:** We access contact names, birthdays, and other significant dates (like anniversaries) stored in your address book.
- **How We Use It:** This information is processed **exclusively on your device** to display events in the calendar and to schedule local notifications.
- **What We DON'T Do:** Your contact information is **never** uploaded, stored on our servers, backed up by us, or shared with any third party. It stays on your phone.

### Notifications

If you grant permission, the App uses local notifications to remind you of upcoming events. These notifications are scheduled and managed entirely on your device. We do not track whether you receive or interact with these notifications.

### Non-Personal Data (Analytics)

We **do not** collect any personal or anonymous analytics data regarding your use of the App. We do not use any third-party analytics or advertising frameworks.

## Data Sharing with Third Parties

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share your personal information with any third parties. Because all your data remains on your device, there is no data for us to share.

## Data Security

All the information the App accesses remains on your device and is protected by the security measures of your operating system (iOS). We do not transmit this data, which is the most effective security measure.

## Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this document.
